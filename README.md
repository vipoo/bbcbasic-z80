# BBC BASIC+ for Z80

This is modified source code based on [BBC BASIC (Z80)](http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic/z80basic.html) by R.T. Russell, who [kindly agreed](http://cowlark.com/2019-06-14-bbcbasic-opensource/index.html) to release the original sources under the [zlib](COPYING) license at the request of David Given.  David published the sources as part of his [cpmish](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpmish) project.

The original sources released by R.T. Russell are in the initial commit.  I have made the following modifications:

- Modified sources to assemble with [z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk)'s z80asm
- Fixed a [bug](https://github.com/davidgiven/cpmish/issues/20) that causes the RUN command to hang under emulators.
- Moved hardware-specific functions from patch.asm to hardware.asm.
- Implemented CLS, TAB, and COLOUR using ANSI escape codes
- Added a Makefile and this README

Planned modifications:

- Graphics support for the TMS9918A video chip for use with my [video card](https://github.com/jblang/TMS9918A/) for the RC2014.
- Sound support for my SN76489 sound card and/or Ed Brindley's YM2149 sound card
- Joystick support for my Game Controller board supporting ColecoVision, Sega, and Atari controllers.
- Back port additional functionality from modern BBC BASIC.

## Build Instructions

Download and install [z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk) (compile if necessary). Make sure z88dk's `bin` directory containing `z80asm` is in your path.

Run `make` to build bbcbasic.com.

If make is not available, run:

```
z80asm -obbcbasic.com -b -d -l -m main.asm exec.asm eval.asm fpp.asm hardware.asm cpm.asm ram.asm
```

# Testing

The submodule `cpm` can be used to run a set of tests scripts.

# BBC Basic Fork for HBIOS Support

This fork of bbc basic, has support for SOUND via the RomWBW HBIOS system

At this stage, the required HBIOS feature support is still in development at [RomWBW-Env](https://github.com/vipoo/RomWBW-Env), and has yet to be
merged into the main repo [wwarthen mainline RomWBW](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW)

## Building

### Dependencies

Requires cpm emulator - with mocking support of HBIOS

You can download and `make && make install` from here [CPM Emulator with HBIOS mocking](https://github.com/vipoo/cpm)

Then within the main directory

`make`

`make test`

This will produce a bbcbasic.com file - that can only be run on a supported system.

To run this version of basic, you need to have a version of RomWBW that includes Video/Sound support - see [RomWBW-Env](https://github.com/vipoo/RomWBW-Env) for more details
